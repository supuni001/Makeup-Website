      <h6 class="text-center"><strong><u> Why is it important?&nbsp; &nbsp;</u></strong></h6>
<p class="text-center"> We have seen many having dull skin, and that hinders their self-confidence and eventually affects their physical and mental health. If your skin glows, you will feel much more confident. This is because glowing skin indicates that you are healthy and care for your face.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong> <u>Let us discuss on how to glow up our face</u></strong></h4>
<br>
<h4><strong><u>&nbsp;How To Do Face Clean Up At Home?</u></strong></h4>
<p class="text-left"> Step 1 - Cleanse. The first step to a face cleanup at home is to cleanse your skin thoroughly with a face cleanser&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">&nbsp;Step 2 - Steam. Go ahead and steam your face with a steamer</p>
<p class="text-left">Step 3 - Exfoliate.</p>
<p class="text-left">&nbsp;Step 4 - Face Pack</p>
<p class="text-left">Step 5 - Toner&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">Step 6 - Sheet Mask</p>
<p class="text-left">Step 7 - Moisturiser&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">Step 8 - Eye Cream&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>6 Lifestyle Changes for Glowing Skin&nbsp;</u></h4>
<p> 1. Drink plenty of water. Your organs—including your skin—absorb moisture when you drink water. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day and avoiding excessive consumption of diuretics like coffee and alcohol can help reduce skin dryness.</p>
<p>2. Make sure you get enough sleep. A good night's rest is the most cost-effective anti-aging remedy for getting glowy skin. Collagen production increases when you sleep, reducing dark circles under the eyes and giving skin a supple feel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Eat foods high in antioxidants. A healthy diet is key to reducing acne breakouts and keeping your skin healthy. Healthy foods that are high in antioxidants and fatty acids—such as avocados, olive oil, and nuts—promote skin wellness so that you can look and feel your best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Take vitamin supplements. Vitamin E protects the skin against free radicals and inflammation. Vitamin C and A can help brighten your skin tone and increase your skin's production of collagen and elastin.</p>
<p>5. Avoid smoking. Smoking shrinks the blood vessels on the outer layer of the skin, which in turn reduces blood flow to the skin. Blood circulation is vital for the production of collagen. Without it, your skin can look dull and pale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Get a dermatology screening. Dermatologists can help patients with skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea, and help patients achieve healthy skin with a radiant glow. Everyone, regardless of their skin type, can benefit from a dermatology screening because dermatologists look for signs of skin cancer and can help prescribe products to help you achieve blemish-free, clear skin.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>10 Home Remedies for Glowing Skin&nbsp;</u></h4>
<p><strong> 1. Soothe skin with virgin coconut oil.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and healing properties. But using coconut oil on your face may not work for every skin type. Do not use if you have allergies to coconut. If you’re able to apply it without irritation, it can be used in a number of ways. You can use coconut oil to: take off makeup soothe your skin barrier promote dewy-looking skin that’s healthy below the surface layer Research shows that coconut oil is a good moisturizer. Try massaging a small amount of coconut oil onto your face. Let it soak in for a few minutes before washing off with your normal cleanser.&nbsp;</p>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>2. Use aloe vera to keep skin strong and health</strong></p>
<p> Aloe vera has healing properties and may stimulate new cell growth. It also soothes and moisturizes without clogging pores. Using aloe vera after you’ve washed your face each day may give your skin that healthy glow. It’s possible to be allergic to aloe vera. Test it first by rubbing a small amount on your forearm and if there’s no reaction in 24 hours, it should be safe to use.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p style=""><strong>3. Moisturize properly after washing your face</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Moisturize your skin with products that lock in moisture, promote healing, and have antioxidant properties to encourage a glowing, youthful look. Don’t exfoliate your skin when it feels dry, and don’t skip moisturizer just because your face feels oily. Apply moisturizer to your skin when it’s still wet from a shower or from rinsing your face. This will lock in extra moisture rather than working on a surface level to make your face feel smooth.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>4. Wear sunscreen daily&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or above can prevent skin cancer. Keeping your skin shielded from harmful UV rays also guards against photoaging, which is the process of skin aging. Make sure to apply a product with sunscreen every morning, even on days when it’s raining or the sky is overcast.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>5. Find a cleansing routine that works</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;You don’t want to rob your skin of moisture by washing it too often, and you don’t want to encourage your pores to produce too much extra oil to compensate for too much washing. Washing your face after you’ve worked up a sweat, first thing in the morning, and right before bed is typically the sweet spot for healthy skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>6. Avoid smoke and secondhand smoke&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When you expose your skin to cigarette smoke, you’re coating your face with all sorts of chemical toxins. This ups the oxidative stress in your skin cells, leading toTrusted Source prematurely aged skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>7. Drink more water&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Your skin is made up of cells that need water to function well. The connection to drinking water and having healthy skin is still ongoing, but at least one 2015 studyTrusted Source concluded there’s a strong link between drinking more water and having healthier skin. Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>8. Eat to nourish your skin&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Eating a diet that’s rich in fruits and vegetables will boost the vitamins and antioxidants in your body. According to the Mayo Clinic, eating healthy fats, like fish oils, and staying away from processed foods with lots of preservatives may have a direct connection to healthier looking skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>9.Take probiotics&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Probiotic supplements may: boost your immune system improve your digestion reduce bloating and inflammation in your digestive tract According to one 2014 studyTrusted Source, probiotics can contribute to healthy hair and visibly glowing skin, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""><strong>10. Shorten your shower&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Steam and heat can open pores and help you get rid of toxins. But running hot water over your skin for more than a few minutes at a time can strip away oil from your skin, leaving it looking tired and dull. Try to minimize your skin’s exposure to water that’s extremely hot. You may also consider cooling down the temperature in the latter part of your shower to improve circulation, which may give your face a more toned and youthful appearance. As an added benefit, this might evenTrusted Source boost your immune system.&nbsp;</p>
